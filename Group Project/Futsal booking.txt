3. How the App Works:
1.	Start:
o	The app begins at the login page.
o	New users can go to the register page to create an account.
2.	Home Page:
o	After logging in, users are directed to the home page with options to:
	Add players.
	Book futsal grounds.
	View matches.
	Exit the application.
3.	Excel Handling:
o	Excel files (users.xlsx, player.xlsx, matches.xlsx, futsal_bookings.xlsx) are used for data storage.
o	If a file doesn't exist, it is created automatically.
