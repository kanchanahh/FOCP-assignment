Project-1
Timing Board

This program is designed to process and display race data from two input files, one containing driver details and another containing lap times.

1. Driver Details Parsing
•	The program reads a driver file containing lines formatted as: ID, Code, Name, Team.
•	It extracts each driver's code, name, and team and stores them in a dictionary where the key is the driver's code (e.g., "HAM"), and the value is a dictionary with their name and team.

2. Lap Times Parsing
•	The program reads a lap times file containing the race location on the first line and lap times for drivers on subsequent lines, formatted as: DriverCode LapTime.
•	It organizes lap times into a dictionary where the key is the driver's code and the value is a list of their lap times.
•	If the file is missing, empty, or has invalid data, it raises errors.

3. Calculating Driver Statistics
•	For each driver, the program calculates:
o	The fastest lap time.
o	The average lap time (sum of lap times divided by the number of laps).

4. Displaying Results
•	The data is presented in a table with the following columns:
o	Driver Code: The unique code identifying the driver.
o	Name: The driver's full name (from the driver file).
o	Team: The team the driver represents.
o	Fastest Lap: The quickest lap time of the driver.
o	Average Lap: The average time of all laps.

5. Highlighting the Fastest Lap
•	After showing the table, the program identifies the driver with the fastest lap across the entire race and prints their time, driver code, and name.

Error Handling
•	If a file is missing, empty, or improperly formatted, the program catches the errors and displays message.
•	It also skips any invalid lap times in the file without crashing.
