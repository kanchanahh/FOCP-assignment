This Python program creates a simple chatbot for the "University of Poppleton." Here's how it works:

Responses Loading: 
A file called responses.json is created so that the chatbot can read responses from there. This file basically contains the predefined answers to specific keywords.

Agent Name: 
It randomly picks a name for the chatbot from a list (e.g., Alexa, Siri, etc.).

Chat Logging: 
The chatbot saves the chat history in a text file with the user's name and the time the chat started.

Chatbot Interaction:

When the program starts, the user enters their name, and the chatbot introduces itself.
The user can type questions or messages, and the chatbot replies based on the keywords it finds in the user’s input.
If no specific response is available, it picks a default reply from the list.
The chatbot ends the chat if the user types "bye," "quit," or "exit."
There’s a small chance (1 in 10) that the chatbot will "disconnect" randomly, mimicking a realistic technical glitch.

Saving the Chat: 
Once the chat ends (naturally or due to disconnection), the conversation is saved as a text file for future reference.

This program is designed very simply to provide interesting interactive mode for the users to interact with a chatbot.
